### Features;


1]CYP P450 3A4 Inhibition Prediction: Evaluates drug-drug interaction risks by predicting how compounds affect the CYP3A4 enzyme.

2]Half-Life Prediction: Predicts the excretion rate of a compound, informing dosing regimens.

3]hERG Toxicity Prediction: Screens compounds for potential cardiotoxicity by predicting their interaction with hERG potassium ion channels.

4]Solubility Prediction: Determines the solubility of compounds, which is crucial for bioavailability.

5]Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeability Prediction: Assesses whether a compound can cross the BBB, critical for drugs targeting the central nervous system.

6]Target Activity Prediction: Provides insights into how compounds interact with biological targets like enzymes or receptors.

7]Molecular Docking: Simulates drug-target interactions, predicting binding affinity and optimizing molecular structures.

8]Polypharmacology Prediction: Identifies multi-target interactions and repurposing potential of drug candidates.
